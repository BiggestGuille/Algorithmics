# Algorithmics
In this repository you will find my personal algorithms developed in Algorithms Design &amp; Analysis.

## Graphs Algorithms 🌎:
Simple graphs algorithms such as Breadth-First-Search or Depth-First-Search are used in some examples.

## Greedy Algorithms 🌏:
Simple greedy algorithms are developed to solve problems such as the knapsack problem.

## Greedy Graphs Algorithms 🌍:
Algorithms such as Prim Algorithm, Kruskal Algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm are used in some examples to solve problems like the graph coloring problem or the travelling salesman problem.

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms 🌏:
The well-known Binary Search Algorithm is used in some examples.

## Backtracking Algorithms 🌎:
Backtracking Algorithm is used to solve problems related with graph coloring, hamiltonian cycles, labyrinths, knapsack problems and others.
